## Story
* To bring the inspiration for everybody around us to be active after a long time lockdown due to Covid-19, we create a wonderful game called “Fall Ninja”. 
* The game operation is quite simple, the ninja is on his way to deliver a secret message to his master, and he must dodge any obstacles coming to avoid being caught, the more obstacle he dodge, the higher score you can get. 

## Gameplay

* As you can see from the pictures above, there are 3 “heart” icon represents 3 HP, once it becomes 0, you will lose the game.
The top right corner is the time (and the score) you survive.
* Try to avoid all viruses, hit the black viruses, you will lose 2 HP, hit the new-created viruses, you lose 1 HP.


## How to play
* <kbd> **A** </kbd> : Move left
* <kbd> **D** </kbd> : Move right
* <kbd> **W** </kbd> : Move forward
* <kbd> **S** </kbd> : Move backward
* <kbd>	**Spacebar** </kbd>&emsp;&nbsp;&ensp;        : Jump
* <kbd> **Esc** </kbd>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;   : Pause

## Applications/Techniques
* As for the gameplay feature, we provide an endless runner gameplay. We set a looping background and ground to with different scroll speed to run endlessly on a “parallax” scene. We set up a difficulty-increasing scene instead of building a two-leveled game. The longer you can survive, the more/faster new viruses are spawned.
* The effects are created using particle system.
* We manage to minimize the hitbox while dashing.
* Most of the character are designed by us ourselves with meaningful purposes.
* Multiple resolutions available with sound effects controls
