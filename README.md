## Story
* To bring the inspiration for everybody around us to be active after a long-time lockdown due to Covid-19, we create a wonderful game called “Fall Ninja”. 
* The game objective is quite simple, the ninja is on his way to deliver a secret message to his master, and he must dodge any obstacles coming to avoid being caught, the more obstacle he dodges, the higher score you can get. 

## Gameplay
